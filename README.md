## Abstract

With a refined movie recommender system, our project aims to tackle the business issue of improving the level of satisfaction and engagement of users in mainstream movie streaming platforms. Users tend to be overwhelmed by the variety of movie options available, causing them to struggle to find movies that cater to their preferences. Through recommendation systems, we can foster a deeper connection between users and the platform, allowing movie-streaming businesses to anticipate favorable business outcomes like improving usersâ€™ satisfaction with the streaming platform and increasing subscription rates. Together, these non-exhaustive business outcomes position such movie-streaming businesses to generate substantial revenue and have a competitive edge in the movie-streaming industry.

To address this business issue, our project addresses the machine learning (ML) problem of improving the accuracy and effectiveness of its movie recommender system. Our approach to developing a more effective recommendation system employs a variety of machine learning techniques alongside creative feature engineering. 

We have utilised mainly, the Rottentomatoes 400k Movie Reviews and MovieLens 100k Dataset. We merged both datasets together to have 5219 unique movies, with 4804 unique reviewers generating 281871 ratings and reviews.
